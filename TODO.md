# TODO

- More testing

- An even higher level function for execution of queries in a more
  convenient way. It should handle busy queries and expired statements
  automatically.

- Add the following wrappers:

  - Better SQL Function support (aggregating ones)
  - Authorization support
  - Trace/profile support
  - progress handler support
  - commit hook support
  - global_recover, get_autocommit, db_handle, temp_directory
  - encryption support (not in SQLite anyway)
